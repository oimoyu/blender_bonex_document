Soft Connection
===========================

Soft connection is a spring, which constraint two rigidbody. But soft connection only constraint location. Often used for lateral constraints on skirts or cloaks to prevent excessive mesh deformation. If you wan to make the floating widget, set the joint instead, because soft connection can not constraint angle.

In rigidbody modify mode, you can press Ctrl+W to add soft connection in batch(skirt using "tube" option, cope using "plane" option, create single soft connection using "pair" option)
