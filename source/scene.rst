**FPS**: Consistent with blender, the higher the fps, the higher speed the scene will be. If you want your scene looks faster, you can decrease to speed up the passage of time.

**Gravity**: The force parallel to the global Z axis is normally -9.81.

**Position Iteration Number**: The higher the value, the more accurate the location of the simulation results.

**Velocity Iteration Number**: The higher the value, the more accurate the velocity of the simulation results.

A long rigidbody chain or model intersection need to increase iterations, because long chains require iterative diffusion to obtain accurate positions.
