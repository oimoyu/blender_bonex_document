"Vivid physics bring an unparalleled level of realism and depth to "
"character animations. For those using Blender, many methods exist to "
"achieve this, including cloth and rigid body simulations etc. In the "
"realm of game engines, rigid body simulations often used for character "
"physics. Despite my efforts to create a free addon "
"`blender_skirt_rigid_generator "
"<https://github.com/oimoyu/blender_skirt_rigid_generator>`_ based on "
"Blender's rigid body simulation, it still with many problems. "
"Consequently, I decided to develop this, leveraging the mature and "
"reliable PhysX physics engine, which offers stable and fast result."

"②There is no need to create any additional auxiliary empty objects or "

"①Fast. The basic object of cloth simulation is mesh vertices, which "
"requires a large amount of calculation, while the basic object of rigid "
"body simulation is a small number of rigid bodies. In essence, it is a "
"proxy method. Rigid body motion drives bone motion -> bones drive "
"vertices motion."

msgid ""
"② Stable and controllable. Rigid body simulation only needs to focus on a"
" limited number of rigid bodies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/introduction.rst:34
msgid ""
"③Keep the shape. When making stylized characters, you need to make some "
"exaggerated shapes that violate the laws of physics. If you use cloth "
"simulation, these shapes will collapse with the collapse of the cloth. "
"Rigid body simulation drives bones, and one bone can control many "
"vertices. , which maintains their relative positions."

"④Prevent mesh intersection. If cloth simulation is used for proxy, "
"contact and mesh intersection are problems. The collision volume of the "
"cloth is only a thin layer, while the collision volume of the rigid body "
"can be defined by yourself. For a fluffy mesh, a larger collision volume "
"can be made to prevent other meshes from intersecting the mold."

"Physx supports CUDA hardware acceleration. Indeed, the powerful parallel "
"computing capability of the GPU can accelerate the calculation speed, but"
" it does not reflect the advantage in the usage scenario of this plug-in."
" When the CPU and GPU are used together, additional data processing "
"overhead is required. For the calculation of very large and large rigid "
"body particles, this overhead accounts for a very small proportion, which"
" can reflect the acceleration advantage. However, if the number of rigid "
"bodies is small, then additional The overhead may even slow down the "
"calculation. And if you want to use GPU acceleration, you also need to "
"come with a huge DLL file. And the performance bottleneck not lies in "
"physx. For the above reasons, adding GPU acceleration function is not "
"considered."
