msgid ""
"Why does relative displacement still appear after simulation even though "
"the joint distance is set to 0?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:8
msgid ""
"The constraints of simulation engines such as physx are not absolute "
"constraints. Too large a force (such as the force of a kinematic rigid "
"body) or too small a position solver iteration number will cause it to "
"break away from the constraints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:10
msgid ""
"①Increase the number of steps of the position iterator to improve "
"calculation accuracy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:12
msgid ""
"② Set the bone attribute to connected, so that the bone is hard "
"constrained to the tail of the parent, and only the rotation result of "
"physx will be applied."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:16
msgid "Why does jitter occur?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:18
msgid ""
"When a rigid body breaks away from a hard constraint, it will try to "
"return to the position where the constraint should be, and will generate "
"a large recovery force. At this time, if there is a kinematic rigid body "
"that prevents it from returning to its supposed position or rotating, it "
"will produce jittery simulation results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:20
msgid ""
"①Adjust the position of kinematic so that it does not conflict with the "
"conditions of hard constraints"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:22
msgid ""
"② Take out the jittered part separately, disable the conflicting "
"kinematic rigid body and recalculate it separately"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:26
msgid ""
"Why is the simulation unable to move despite setting upper and lower "
"displacement limits?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:27
msgid ""
"① Check whether connected is checked in the bone attributes. Connected is"
" the option for blender to lock the bone displacement. Bones with this "
"option checked cannot move in posture mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:29
msgid ""
"② Whether the joint stiffness and the rigid body mass match. If the "
"spring stiffness is too large or the rigid body mass is too small, the "
"force will not be enough to move the rigid body, so it cannot move."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:32
msgid "What should I do if the FPS is too low during playback?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"① Playback without modify mode, in modify mode you can view the rigidbody"
" shape, but the drawing api efficiency of the preview is not high, and "
"some data need to be calculated in real time, so the playback speed will "
"be slowed down when there are lots rigid bodies exist."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"②Try to disable setting keyframe option. Blender has performance issues "
"in setting keyframes. When there are too many existing keyframes for an "
"object or bone, the time required to set a keyframe will increase "
"linearly with the number of existing keyframes. Therefore, when playback "
"simulation, if there is a low fps, and checking the log found that the "
"frame generation time of physx is also very short, so the cause of the "
"lag is the performance problem of Blender's keyframe setting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:37
msgid ""
"③ Reduce the number of iteration steps. A reasonable number of iteration "
"steps can improve the calculation speed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:39
msgid "④Try to bake the animation into key frames and then play it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"⑤ Try to divide the simulation into separate parts, and simulate them "
"separately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:44
msgid "Why can't I move rigid body bones during playback?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:46
msgid ""
"① Check whether the bones you move have existing keyframes. In Blender, "
"K-framed bones cannot be moved manually in live playback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq.rst:48
msgid ""
"② Check whether the bone you move is a dynamic rigid body bone, because "
"every dynamic playback frame will be controlled by physx, so the user "
"cannot move it"
msgstr ""
