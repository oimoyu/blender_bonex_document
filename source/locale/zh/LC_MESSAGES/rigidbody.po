"In bone post mode, click the \"Start Modify\" button to access the Rigid "
"Body modification interface. Within this interface, you have press \"C\" "
"to set selected bones as rigid body bones, which allows them to be driven"
" by physx during animations. Additionally, you can view the shape of the "
"rigid body and change the properties of the selected rigid body bone in "
"this mode."

"Within rigid Body modification interface, when you select a rigidody "

"**Dynamic**: A dynamic rigid body is a rigid body calculated by physx and"

"**Kinematic**: The kinematic rigid body is controlled by the user's key "
"frame animation. Its movement is absolute and not affected by any force. "
"And it can collide with the dynamic rigid body to make dynamic rigid body"
" motion."

"**Customize Rigidbody Shape**: Within rigid Body modification interface, "
"press \"E\" to edit selected rigidbody. Physx's dynamic rigid body only "
"supports convex polygons. If it is a concave polygon, it will be baked "
"into a convex polygon according to the vertices. The baked shape can be "
"observed in the Physx Visual Debugger. For physx, the calculation speed "
"of custom mesh rigid bodies is not as fast as its default shape. If there"
" are no special needs, try to use the default shape."
