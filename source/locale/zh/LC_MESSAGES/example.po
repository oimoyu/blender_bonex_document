"For rigid bodies on a chain, it is equivalent to having a spring between "
"them to connect them two by one. You need to adjust the appropriate "
"parameters to make it meet the results you want."

"①The first is to maintain the shape. The rigid body chain will sag due to"
" the influence of gravity. If you don’t want it to sag due to gravity, "
"then adjust the gravity to 0, or reduce the mass or increase the "
"stiffness of the connection (pay attention to the arrangement of the "
"parameters, because one parameter changes will lead to other aspects "
"changes)"

"②The relationship between mass and spring stiffness. When a rigid body "
"chain shakes, it is affected by the force of the spring connection and "
"the inertial force of the rigid body. The greater the mass, the greater "
"the inertial force and the better the shaking; the greater the spring "
"stiffness, the spring will The greater the force required to deform, the "
"harder it is to shake. For example, imagine that a piece of iron is tied "
"to a spring and a piece of paper is tied to the spring. Which one shakes "
"better? It should be noted that the greater the stiffness of the spring, "
"the greater the rebound force. Therefore, when the spring of large "
"stiffness shakes, it will rock back and forth around the initial "
"position."

"③The relationship between spring stiffness and damping. Damping is the "
"force that prevents the spring from returning to the origin. The greater "
"the damping, the greater the resistance (the resistance will not exceed "
"the rebound force of the spring). It slows down the rebound due to spring"
" stiffness, and is the parameter you want if you don't want the rigid "
"body to rock back and forth around its initial position, or if you want "
"the motion to look a little softer."

"④The relationship between mass and motion. The greater the mass, the "
"greater the inertial force. If you want to express the feeling of an "
"object staying in the air, counter-intuitively, you need to increase the "
"mass, because a rigid body with a small mass is more likely to be pulled "
"by the spring stiffness and return quickly, the time in the air is not "
"long, and an object with a larger mass has a larger inertial force, and "
"the same spring stiffness takes more time to pull it, so it can reflect "
"the feeling of being in the air."

"For the tail, you want medium stiffness so it can bounce back, and medium"

"For the breast, a slightly higher stiffness is needed to produce a "
"certain rocking effect and reflect elasticity. At the same time, "
"adjusting the displacement limit slightly higher than 0 can achieve "
"better physical effects."

"需要注意的是，kinimatic刚体的父骨骼中，不应出现dynamic刚体。因为子骨骼的变换受到父骨骼的影响，而kinimatic刚体的运动又会影响dynamic刚体，导致循环作用，搞乱模拟结果。"
" 如果你仍然需要制作像两端挂绳一样的效果，那么尾部设置的kinimatic刚体需要使用copy "
"transform骨骼约束，将其绑定到空物体上，使其位移和旋转钧脱离父骨骼的影响才能正常使用（要注意connected不要勾选，否则会锁定位置导致异常）"
