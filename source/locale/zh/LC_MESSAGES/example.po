"For rigid bodies on a chain, it is equivalent to having a spring between them "
"to connect them two by one. You need to adjust the appropriate parameters to "
"make it meet the results you want."
msgstr ""
"对于链条上的刚体来说，相当于它们之间有一个弹簧，将它们两个一一连接起来。 您需要"
"调整适当的参数，使其达到您想要的结果。"

"①The first is to maintain the shape. The rigid body chain will sag due to the "
"influence of gravity. If you don’t want it to sag due to gravity, then adjust "
"the gravity to 0, or reduce the mass or increase the stiffness of the "
"connection (pay attention to the arrangement of the parameters, because one "
"parameter changes will lead to other aspects changes)"
msgstr ""
"①首先是保持形状。 刚体链条会因重力的影响而下垂。 如果不想因为重力而下垂，那么将"
"重力调整为0，或者减少质量或者增加连接的刚度（注意参数的安排，因为一个参数的变化"
"会导致其他方面的变化）"

msgid ""
"②The relationship between mass and spring stiffness. When a rigid body chain "
"shakes, it is affected by the force of the spring connection and the inertial "
"force of the rigid body. The greater the mass, the greater the inertial force "
"and the better the shaking; the greater the spring stiffness, the spring will "
"The greater the force required to deform, the harder it is to shake. For "
"example, imagine that a piece of iron is tied to a spring and a piece of paper "
"is tied to the spring. Which one shakes better? It should be noted that the "
"greater the stiffness of the spring, the greater the rebound force. Therefore, "
"when the spring of large stiffness shakes, it will rock back and forth around "
"the initial position."
msgstr ""
"②质量与弹簧刚度的关系。 当刚体链条晃动时，它受到弹簧连接力和刚体惯性力的影响。 "
"质量越大，惯性力越大，晃动效果越好； 弹簧刚度越大，弹簧变形所需的力就越大，就越"
"难晃动。 例如，想象一块铁绑在弹簧上，一张纸绑在弹簧上。 哪个抖得比较好？ 需要注"
"意的是，弹簧的刚度越大，回弹力越大。 因此，当大刚度的弹簧晃动时，会围绕初始位置"
"来回晃动。"

#: ../../source/example.rst:15
msgid ""
"③The relationship between spring stiffness and damping. Damping is the force "
"that prevents the spring from returning to the origin. The greater the "
"damping, the greater the resistance (the resistance will not exceed the "
"rebound force of the spring). It slows down the rebound due to spring "
"stiffness, and is the parameter you want if you don't want the rigid body to "
"rock back and forth around its initial position, or if you want the motion to "
"look a little softer."
msgstr ""
"③弹簧刚度与阻尼的关系。 阻尼是阻止弹簧返回原点的力。 阻尼越大，阻力越大（阻力不"
"会超过弹簧的回弹力）。 它会因弹簧刚度而减慢回弹速度，如果您不希望刚体围绕其初始"
"位置来回摇动，或者如果您希望运动看起来更柔和一些，那么它就是您需要的参数。"

msgid ""
"④The relationship between mass and motion. The greater the mass, the greater "
"the inertial force. If you want to express the feeling of an object staying in "
"the air, counter-intuitively, you need to increase the mass, because a rigid "
"body with a small mass is more likely to be pulled by the spring stiffness and "
"return quickly, the time in the air is not long, and an object with a larger "
"mass has a larger inertial force, and the same spring stiffness takes more "
"time to pull it, so it can reflect the feeling of being in the air."
msgstr ""
"④质量与运动的关系。 质量越大，惯性力越大。 如果你想表达物体停留在空中的感觉，与"
"直觉相反，你需要增加质量，因为质量小的刚体更容易被弹簧刚度拉动并快速返回，时间 "
"在空气中停留的时间不长，质量越大的物体惯性力就越大，同样的弹簧刚度拉动它需要的"
"时间也就越多，所以更能体现在空中的感觉。"

"⑤The scale is important. The simulation is carried out in accordance with the "
"laws of physics. For example, when giving a rigid body to the breast bone, you "
"may find that it cannot shake up and down. You may need to consider whether "
"the scaling is too small, resulting in the bone being too short and the center "
"of mass moment arm being too short. In this case You can try to enlarge the "
"model, but this is often troublesome, then you can try increasing the mass of "
"the rigidbody or decrease stiffness."
msgstr ""
"⑤缩放尺寸很重要。 模拟是根据物理定律进行的。 例如，当给胸骨赋予刚体时，你可能会"
"发现它无法上下晃动。 你可能需要考虑是否缩放太小，导致骨骼太短，质心力臂太短。 "
"在这种情况下你可以尝试放大模型，但这往往很麻烦，那么你可以尝试增加刚体的质量或"
"降低刚度。"

"of the tail, but you can give higher damping to reflect the soft effect."

"collides with other things it will not bounce too much in real world."

"对于头发，您需要较低的刚度，因为头发非常柔软，并且需要较高的阻尼，因为头发很轻"

"It should be noted that the dynamic rigid body should not appear in the parent "
"bone of the kinimatic rigid body. Because in Blender, the transformation of "
"the child bone is affected by the parent bone, and in PhysX, the movement of "
"the kinimatic rigid body will affect the dynamic rigid body, which will lead "
"to cyclic effects and mess up the simulation results. If you still want to "
"create such an effect, then the kinimatic rigid body set at the tail needs to "
"use \"copy transform\" bone constraints so that its displacement and rotation "
"are free from the influence of the parent bone (note that connected is not "
"checked, otherwise the displacement will be locking)"
msgstr ""
"需要注意的是，dynamic刚体不应出现在kenimatic刚体的父骨骼中。 因为在Blender中，"
"子骨骼的变换受到父骨骼的影响，而在PhysX中，kenimatic刚体的移动会影响dynamic刚"
"体，从而导致循环作用，搞乱模拟结果。 如果你仍然想创造这样的效果，那么尾部设置的"
"运动学刚体需要使用“copy transform”骨骼约束，使其位移和旋转脱离父骨骼的影响（注"
"意不勾选connected ，否则位移将被锁定）"
