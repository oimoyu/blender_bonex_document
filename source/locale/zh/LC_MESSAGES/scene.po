"**FPS**: Should be consistent with blender, the higher the fps, the "
"higher speed the scene will be. If you want your scene looks faster, you "
"can decrease to speed up the passage of time."
msgstr "**FPS**：应该与 Blender 一致，FPS 越高，场景的速度就越快。 如果你想让你的场景看起来更快，你可以减少以加快时间的流逝。"

#: ../../source/scene.rst:12
msgid "**Gravity**: The force parallel to the global Z axis is normally -9.81."
msgstr "**重力**：平行于全局 Z 轴的力，通常为 -9.81。"

#: ../../source/scene.rst:15
msgid ""
"**Sub Step Number**: Split one animation frame into multiple small "
"frames, and simulation them. Used to solve the penetration problem of "
"high-speed moving objects. This is performance heavy operation,if not "
"necessary, set it as 1."
msgstr "**子步数**: 将一个动画帧拆分成多个小帧，然后进行模拟。用于解决高速运动物体的穿透问题。这是性能消耗很大的操作，如无必要，请设置为1。"

#: ../../source/scene.rst:17
msgid ""
"Sub step means more accurate simulation, but sometimes you may find that "
"the rigidbody never end after increasing this, if this is not you want, "
"you can decrease sub step or increase damping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scene.rst:19
msgid ""
"Never end movement issues explan: the inaccurate simulation means "
"inaccurate numerical calculation, which will lead the small number is "
"truncated, this means more energy is loosing over time. On the other "
"hand, too accurate means the energy that should be lost is retained, so "
"the simulation results show that it is more inclined to motion. If you "
"want something like the spring toy below, this is absolute you need."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scene.rst:27
msgid ""
"The video below shows when a high-speed object moving, increase the sub "
"step means the movement is split into small movement, so the rigidbody "
"can interact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Position Iteration Number**: The higher the value, the more accurate "
"the location of the simulation results."
msgstr "**位置迭代次数**：值越高，模拟结果的位置越准确。"

#: ../../source/scene.rst:39
msgid ""
"**Velocity Iteration Number**: The higher the value, the more accurate "
"the velocity of the simulation results."
msgstr "**速度迭代次数**：值越高，模拟结果的速度越准确。"

#: ../../source/scene.rst:41
msgid ""
"A long rigidbody chain or model intersection need to increase iterations,"
" because long chains require iterative diffusion to obtain accurate "
"positions."
msgstr "长的刚体链或模型相交需要增加迭代次数，因为长链需要迭代扩散才能获得准确的位置。"
