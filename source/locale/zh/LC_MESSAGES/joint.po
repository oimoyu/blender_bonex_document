"Within rigid Body modification interface, press \"C\", a rigid body will "
"be created at position of the bone. If the bone has a parent, a joint "
"will be created at the head of the bone to connect the parent bone, the "
"child bone can rotate and move around the joints. The axis in the joint "
"settings means the local axis of the bone (The local axis of the bone can"
" be set to display in the armature properties armature->Data->Viewport "
"Display->Axes). The center of mass of the rigidbody will be fixed at the "
"tail of the bone, so the behavior of collision as a single rigidbody will"
" be a bit strange without a parent bone."

"**Hard constraints**: the distance constraints and angle constraints set "

"exceed. If too much force pushes him away from the hard constraint range,"
" it will be subject to a large reaction force trying to return."

"**Soft constraints**: The springs connecting rigidbodies can be called "
"soft constraints, that is, the stiffness and damping in the panel. It "

" range of hard constraints."
